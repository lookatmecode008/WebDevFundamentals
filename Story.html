        <p>I was born in 2002, April the 12th, a real even baby. From day one I knew I was with the wrong family, when the doctors finally realised I wasn't white they returned me to my mother. Accomplices to my suffering. Mother was seemed like an emotional rollercoaster operated by a tired mokey, grandparents were real sus but served real love, dad heard i was born and really tried to put in that work but my mom's a broken woman, bro broke, braked and bounced. Accomplice number 2.</p>

        <p>I was an ugly baby, but a baby nonetheless. Apparently had multiple attempts on my life (ops knew they had to strike early) but came out short kind and charming. Arguably the most handsome of my mother's three, adoration of the entire family AND respect from the streets for shitting in the bucket I was supposed to kick, life seemed like a real win for me. When the family migrated to Fochville, they did not know what storm they just brought</p>

        <p>The boy blazed through pre-, primary and secondary school like it was nothing. People called me a prodigy, a genius. My secret was just my ability to read and understand English, a skill I got from spending hours in front of the tv. I could also recognise patterns thus made predicting things pretty easy for me. I got all that glory and not a single girlfriend😭, absolutely useless!</p>

        <p> I made acouple of mistakes in my life that I genuinely wish I could take back. My grade 10 subject choices were poor despite the support I thought I had. Said some mean things to people who hurt me. Rejoiced at the death and suffering of people who bullied me. Choosing to live and never feeling alive. Not making enough mistakes. I really have not recovered from these, but the wounds can only be healed by time and self-acceptance. 
        </p>
        <p>When I got to university (I got a bursary), I realised that my life was really in my hands. I decided it was time I started exercising some freewill. I did everything my heart desired, made sure every single coin brought joy to the inner child who never got to grieve or be elated. I regret not having invested in my future, but it was certainly worth it. Bursary decided not to pay my final year fees, so I never got to attend my graduation ceremony or receieve my certificate. Real bummer there. The blessing was that the verirising student debt that was not crippling my ability to make something of myself served as apurpose for my to at least wake up for.
        </p>
        <p>I just went through my first year as neither an academic weapon nor a child, fun! Got a couple of jobs, discovered an interest in IT and realised I am adult now, people actually care about the shit I do and say.I realised I have to make some tough choices about my position and responsibility in the family, potentially reducing contact with some and investing in others. Moving to a different city was certainly the best decision I could have ever made, gave birth to so many avenues that I reckon I may just make that a regular thing🤣.

        <p>I started this website at age 23. It will probaly keep changing and developing as I do. I am at a very bleak and empty period in my life right now, not reallly sad but overwhlemed, by my grief and regrets, adult responsibilities for a fragile soul, desire to achieve more than I have, need to help others, need to preserve myself, too many things, not enough me. I know I will survive, if they couldn't kill me as baby then they will NEVER take my life! </p>
