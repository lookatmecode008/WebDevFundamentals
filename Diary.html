                    People have the inherent capacity to do good. We also have the option not to. That is a childish
                    definition of evil, that it is anti-good. i define it as the extreme of anything, too many cooks spoil
                    the broth much the same way too much self love is pride, too much nourishment is gluttony, too
                    little love is indifference, too little kindness is cruelty and too little science is poetry.
                    I don't know how to feel about calling people evil but i genuinely feel like they have been exposed
                    to too much or too little so they figured they only solution is either succumb or compensate. You
                    succumb to a loveless home by fearing love or exhibiting the lack of love you may feel to the next
                    person. you compensate for it by excessive self-love, dependency, seclusion, nonchalance. Evil
                    people are victims of forces they had no control over, maybe this is me compensating for my
                    sense of powerlessness.
                    I am demonising qualities I wish I had, just as Christianity can see assertiveness as pride, maybe
                    I ascribe to evil what is to me an unattainable quality. I don't think I'm evil, but someone out there
                    thinks I am. It's weird to think about but it is what it is, I am a cog in the machine I'm studying.

                    Bear with me on this one. Programming has evolved substantially in a relatively short period of
                    time, in a couple of decades we went from punch cards and floppy disks, to computers that can
                    learn and think somewhat independently. That's a giant hop. One the peak benefits of the latter is
                    that now programmes can help programmers program programmes, imagine being able to help
                    God create your next baby, isn't that crazy?! This got so good that manual programming is not
                    only time consuming but has become substantially easier to learn.
                    This is where I come in. I have the content (literally ideas that I want to outlive me, reach
                    someone, weird them out and bring about world peace), the passion (i love systems, especially
                    when i have no business being around them), and the time (I'm 24 bro, young enough to learn
                    new skills, old enough to wisely adapt on the fly). When the limit of my knowledge befall me and I
                    crumble into dismay, ashamed of my own ignorance, I turn to the mother of the child I want to
                    birth. I beg her to at least not just lie there.
                    Ok. Basically, when I can't figure something out, I would ask the AI to help me. No, not vibe-coding
                    (that's just asking God to create another baby for you and fix it when it breaks, except God here is
                    extremely literal and takes everything verbatim). I still write the code and learn, it's just that it's
                    purely at my pace and there's pretty much no standardisation except one I self-impose. It's
                    learning manual coding while mastering AI fluency AND upgrading my personal skillset. It's one
                    thing to be a manual programmer, another to be a vibe-coder, it's an entirely new ball game to
                    navigate the tight rope between them without falling to either.
                    That's really one of the drawbacks of AAP. The difficulty of manual coding (of learning in general,
                    really) and the ease and convenience of vibe-coding kinda makes the whole thing extremely hard
                    to navigate, like driving on ice ... at full speed ... in traffic ... with a baby on board. That's how I
                    know it's worth the effort, when the easy way out is right there and the honour is only in the hard
                    route. My truth balances between them.

                I hardly ever wonder if I am a good friend, son, brother, co-worker or enemy. Yet i always wonder
                if I am a good person. Isn't that weird? I am assuming that personhood is separate from the
                fragments that make it up. Look, I am inclined to agree that people are more than the sum of
                their parts, but there is a golden thread that runs through those parts, harmonising them to form
                a unified image of personhood that becomes more than it is when the actor instills their own
                appraisal of said personhood. Indeed, it is both them and I that make me a good or bad person.
                For the most part, you'll never find a clear cut between those two camps, in fact, it is so rare that
                it is best to assume that most would be in the grey area between them, saying you're both or
                neither good nor bad. Extremism is hardly ever a good thing, if they hate you then all they see
                about is bad and vice versa.
                I think that's one of the key things about personhood and belonging that we tend to forget. That it
                is important, not to be loved, but to be understood, to be accepted, to be heard, and to belong.
                Finding ground zero is crucial, that's the golden thread, the one unifying quality of your
                personhood. Scientists do not look for the truth, they look for evidence of it, they look for
                witnesses who say "yes, this is the truth." Not only is finding the pure truth an extremely difficult
                endeavour, but it can just as easily "lie". Think Pluto, a victim of the truth. The seeker must
                consider their own experience as informative rather than declarative, only the evidence can
                determine their truth.

            This is just one of those "good to note" notes. The Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around
            the Sun.For a point on the Earth to move around the axis back to the origin, it would take ~24
            hours (in laymen's terms, one rotation is equal to 24 hours).For the Earth itself to move around
            the Sun all the way back to the original starting point it would take ~8766 hours, or 365.25 days.
            That's the foundation. You see the problem already?
            If a year = one revolution, then the year actually ends on the first day of the succeeding year at
            06:00. We both know how not ok that is. The difference is too small to shift the calendar but also
            too big to ignore. We cannot assign 6 more hours to December 31st and completely fall out of
            sync with Earth rotation, nor can we ignore the extra hours as the 6 hour decrement would throw
            off our conclusion with anything that has to do with Earth's revolution, such as weather
            predictions. We also can't just "start the New Year at that time" because that creates global
            incoherence that timezones wish they could compensate for, 06:00 and 18:00 would be the
            official hours for the New Year to begin on both hemispheres of the Earth, obviously not good. I
            personally think the biggest reason would be that those 6 hours... do not have a day. January first
            and December thirty-first are whole days as they are both 24 hours long. We cannot attribute the
            6 hours as the first day of the new year nor the last day of the past year because, by definition, it
            is not a day!
            So we can't add, ignore, or compensate yearly for those 6 hours. Perhaps we could do all that?
            Ignore the 6 hours for three years, add them together with the fourth year and compensate for
            the missing hours every four years with a day. This settles most concerns, with the added
            convenience of a month that's lacking days just makes it all the better. Leap Year is just that. A
            year where humans compensate for our incessant desire to standardise and rationalise, finally
            realising the limits to how much we control.

                Anger and Fear are weird feelings. I can't find any reason they would overlap because one fights
                in power and another flees in weakness. Nothing physiological is useless, at least not
                evolutionarily. So anger is a feeling that gets us psyched against something, literally putting you
                in fight mode. Fear is the same but puts you in between fighting (similar to anger), getting the fuck outta there,
                freezing or just making yourself as small as possible. In the end I just think
                these are weird feelings. Very hard to express healthily too.
                I think I have a lot of fear. It's best described as anxiety though. Most of it is directed at my
                psychosocial safety and sense of worth. A good part of it is based on the futility of our existence
                and life's inherent meaninglessness. Most times I am afraid of being myself, sometimes I am
                afraid of one day losing everyone I love, sometimes it's the fear of dying alone because I chose
                Nietzsche while my peers chose Hennessy. All the time though, I am afraid of living a
                purposeless life.
                I do not think I am an angry person. I also do not think I have a lot of repressed anger. I think I am
                a scared person, dubbed myself fragile and weak. That's where my anger comes from, a deep
                desire to have some sense of control over my life. I do not yet have a healthy, socially acceptable
                way to express this anger, all my models showed how anger is evil and is used to oppress and
                destroy another person. It's a disgusting feeling. I am filthy from just thinking about it. So I would
                rather not express it. Wait...if my sense of fear is directly proportional to my anger then... I guess
                I do have a lot of repressed anger😂

            I think it was Myers and Briggs who came up with the personality trait test that reduces one's
            personality to a four letter code. Each letter represents a trait that is most prominent when
            assessing the responses provided by the assessee. I want to go through my code, just have proof
            that I actually agree with it. I was dubbed an INFJ/P, otherwise referred to as the mediator.
            The I refers to introversion over extroversion. It means I gain my vitality through interacting with
            my internal environment. I do better with small, intimate crowds and not a fan of the big groups
            and loud living. Couldn't agree more with this one. I don't do loud. I love my space. I don't want to
            be the center of attention and just being alone with my thoughts is enough for me. This does not
            mean I do not go outside or hang out with people, it means those are optional in rejuvenating my
            sense of vitality. Ideally I would have a cottage some where in the woods with other introverted
            people but instead I am in the suburbs, struggling to make friends and find my footing in a new
            city.
            N for intuition over sensing. Yep, i trust my gut feeling over facts. If something needs to be done
            then it better sit well with me otherwise I am not doing it. This means I am creative and great at
            coming up with novel solutions, sure they don't always make sense or align with reality but you
            can always count on me to say something unhinged. I wade through the world by gut and not
            concrete facts so my reasoning may be wonky but my ideas will always be fresh.
            F for feeling over Thinking. No surprise that someone who's intuitive is emotionally driven. My
            guide to making judgements is based on feelings, this means I am empathetic, patient,
            understanding and maybe a little bit emotionally unstable. I do not think things through, I feel
            them through. For me, how something makes me feel is a bigger metric than what sense it
            makes. Of course this is not ideal as it can lead to martyrdom or coldness but it has been great
            for someone interested in being a psychotherapist.
            J for Judging, which is on par with Perceiving. These are best described as descriptors of how I
            plan, whether i use lists and calendars and shit, or do I just wing it. I got a good balance of both. I
            do plan my budget but include an amount that is just for impulsive spending. It also means I
            control my freedom, an intuitive and emotional person has to have some structure lest he
            destroys himself. Boundaries, schedules, budgets and timelines are some of the ways I govern
            my impulsiveness.
            It is important to note that Myers and Briggs oversimplified one of the most complex phenomena
            in psychology. So, take what I claim with a grain of salt. The only comfort is that their claim has
            scientific grounding, unlike the zodiac people.

            I just read a story about a "white genocide" in my country. Trump and Musk are so horny for white
            supremacy and global superiority, they made up a story about how white farmers were subjected
            to racist policy and murder under the ANC government. In response, our president was like "bro...
            we don't murder white people... we murder everybody󰣿".
            I have thoughts. Firstly, the president is right. Undoubtedly, more black people are murdered in
            South Africa than white people. This is just demographic probabilities 󰣿. A majority of farms
            employ black workers, therefore, in time of attack, it is far more likely that a black person would
            be hurt or worse than the other race. More black people are victims of crime simply because of
            probability as they make up a majority of the population 󰣿.
            Secondly, it is not necessarily a race thing... ok maybe not entirely... ok it's a race thing. Apartheid
            ensured wealth is unevenly distributed along racial lines, white farmers are the epitome of that
            wealth. I'm not sure why criminals would target farms, maybe because they are isolated and
            enforcers would take real time to travel there, maybe the farmer's false sense of security got
            them to buy fancy, expensive things, maybe they are easier targets than a fancy mansion with 64
            cameras at each door󰣿 look I'm no criminal so I can't reason for them. All I know is that no one
            wants a difficult journey to their desire, criminals included. A majority of farms are easy targets
            with the potential for a big score since they're owned by white people
            Thirdly, it makes sense that the government's redistributive policy threatens the privileged. Gov't
            is simply trying to even out the massive wealth gap within the population, a wealth gap based on
            a racist historical system thus making wealth racially segregated, at least between white and
            non-white groups. It is understandable that the policy can be. interpreted as being anti-white
            when it is anti-wealth-gap. The expropriation bill is not racially motivated, the wealth hoarded by
            previous generations of white farmers as a result of Apartheid, however, is.
            Look I'm no political analyst but I'm convinced of a hidden agenda. The Trump Admin is
            aggressively trying to push a narrative disputed by plenty of knowledgeable people and even
            denied by the very people they claim to be the saviours of. They are either trying to punish RSA
            for expressing its sovereignty or they just tryna bomb us and Trump doesn't wanna hurt his best
            friend's people. This is exactly why I don't do politics, I feel so powerless at the sight of all these
            names. Thank God we at least have a competent and competitive political landscape, otherwise
            we would be getting bullied more than we already are.

            I know a bunch of random science stuff i got into throughout my life. See, ever since i was a
            handsome baby, I've had a thing for science🤭idk man, i think it started in the fourth grade when i
            found out about the solar system. big balls of rocks and gas and gravity and heat and space and
            all that! Something about that whole thing made me horny🥴. That's when i started reading up on
            anything that piqued my interest.
            Schrodinger's cat. Everyone knows this one. A theory in quantum mechanics that basically states
            that two seemingly polar options exist simultaneously, and that observation is the only way to
            certain one option. I'm not sure what it's for, but i recall something along the lines of something
            being in two oppositional states but immediately being fixed on one upon measurement,
            observation to be specific. It really doesn't make sense to me but I love the approach. Anything is
            possible until we actually observe it. There's prolly a life lesson somewhere in there too🤔.
            Lightyears are another weird phenomenon I couldn't stop thinking about. What do you mean the
            fastest thing IN EXISTENCE takes YEARS to travel a distance?!?! The distances in space are so
            incomprehensible, like i get that the Earth's hundreds of thousands of kilometres wide, but i just
            can't wrap my head around the fact that there is a distance so far away that light, the fastest
            thing in existence (i think), takes YEARS to cover it. That's insane.
            What's even more insane is that we can never ever go that fast since we are made of matter, and
            so is everything else that keeps us alive. I'm not sure whether light can travel that fast because it
            is not matter; or maybe it's a unique kind of matter, like plasma, or maybe the qualities of light
            and its speed are simply impossible for anything with matter to possess. The basic definition of
            matter is anything that has mass (can be affected by gravity) and volume (can take up space),
            light can be affected by gravity that is strong enough (like that of a black hole) but light is
            physically incapable of taking up space, it's just particles bouncing off objects and not an actual
            visible thing (the irony isn't lost). I have not refined this idea yet but I think i read somewhere that
            matter would literally break down if it attempted to move at a noticeable fraction of light speed,
            friction (produces heat, matter would simply burn) is amongst the bigger inhibitors.
            Now, chaos theory is one idea that really got me thinking. It claims that in any apparent chaotic
            system, there's an underying law, rule or order that keeps the entire thing chaotically consistent.
            In essence, it rejects randomness as an explanation for chaos. It basically describes the
            behaviour of a system that make no obvious sense. Evidence of its validity can be found across
            multiple domains of science, especially social science. Social problems appear chaotic until you
            start noticing the patterns, the colonial history, government corruption, loss of values and
            negotiable judiciary processes. The child might seem unruly and disorderly, until you start
            noticing that this is a trend amongst fatherless and impoverished in anomic townships. There are
            patterns in everything and everyone, self awareness is to notice and critically analyse them to
            draw conclusions about them, politics are identifying systematic trends and identifying their
            most probable cause and effective solution. Just like that I got roped into sociological thinking,
            linking what appear to be chaotic phenomena to regular structural patterns. Just... wow🤗

            Once upon a time, I had faith. I believed there is a good, powerful, just and loving God. I believed
            people were good and just made bad choices. I believed ancestors were fair and reasonable as
            the people they once were. My years in university broke that. They broke everything I used to hold
            up my sense of meaning. Behavioral Sciences, what an eye opening experience that discipline is😔
            Psychology. It was supposed to be Freud and "Love Yourself" all over my notes, little did I know
            what it held for me💔Psych 121 explored social and community psychology, basically arguing
            that milieu has more impact on individual behaviour than i thought. I learnt that people influence
            people without their consent. People are brilliant individually but so predictable as a collective.
            We seem to exert some kind of coercive group mindset when in social situations, mandating a
            need to belong and be consistent with the group. It's why most would rather watch than intervene
            when one of our own is in trouble. We all happen to think "someone should have intervened by
            now" and so we all freeze, waiting for that someone. Brilliant individually, dumb as a herd.
            Sociology, the study of society and its constituents. This is where my faith really got destroyed.
            All major classical theories conclude that faith is both universal and can be weaponised. The
            works of Karl Marx come to mind. That piece of shit made me aware of how much suffering
            humans inflict on each other just to bag a bigger bag before they die. He made me aware of how
            social systems and their components are constantly weaponised in the name of wealth retention
            and oppression of the working class. The system of capitalism exploits faith to pacify the
            masses that it needed to maintain the uneven power relations that perpetuate uneven wealth
            distribution and distraught poverty. I couldn't stop thinking about it. My faith, a weapon against
            me. The realisation disoriented me. My critical mind couldn't stop thinking about how much
            power we believe God has yet his most vulnerable continue to be vulnerable, how the Bible
            glorifies poverty and submissiveness to authority like badges of honour, how God's people would
            rather build mega churches than be on the ground and make an actual difference in people's
            lives, how the Word demonises qualities that uphold individuality and self-direction., i just
            spiralled.
            I could not hold my meaning framework with the evidence I had been provided. I could not
            pretend that the argument posited by science was not valid, plausible or, to a degree, true. My
            mind refused to accept Christianity as it were nor believe my will becomes secondary in social
            situations, but I knew that forces that shape said circumstances were too great for me to
            overcome alone. So i delved into existential philosophy after receiving inspiration from Viktor
            Frankl on suffering and meaning. I met Nietzsche and Camus who told me about life being
            inherently meaningless and so it befell man to make it meaningful. My faith collapsed because
            the reality of its foundation was no longer able to tolerate the reality I then lived in nor was it able
            to keep up with my sudden, rapid growth. I had to breakthrough to the other side of the void, I
            could abandon my faith entirely or make it adapt to who, when and where i am. In any case, my
            faith was imposed on me and i adopted it, now that I have every reason to let it go-it became ever
            more beautiful to have it by choice. Existentialism made bearing human suffering, greed,
            mortality and futility all the more bearable.
            I got to meet urban anthropology and its arguments of contemporary evidence for the use of
            systems and structures to perpetuate poverty and uneven wealth distribution, inducing and
            maintaining affluence for some and suffering for most. Sociology also struck a pivot, debating on
            environmental, social and educational inequality as being products of a self-fulfilling system that
            feeds off the legacy of Apartheid, contemporary capitalist assertions and a failing government.
            All these were topped up with Psychopathology, a module that showed me how scary psychiatry
            and clinical practice are. From narcissistic and bipolar people to schizophrenics and split
            personality disorders, nothing about my final year was good or soothing except that it was MY
            FINAL YEAR.

            People can see me as aloof, weird and a bit awkward. None of these are lies. I honestly struggle
            to be "normal" (whatever that means) and it feels so overwhelming to have to pretend to be. I
            have to say the right things, gesture appropriately, time my inputs, manage my emotions, be
            comfortable and promote conversation all in a single interaction!
            Look, I know there's something off about me. I can't pathologise it because it might just be a
            normal personality trait I just never see in others, but I also can't normalise it as it really affects
            how I interact with people. I'm not sure what, if at all, is wrong but I know that dreading to talk to
            people is not something people would see as normal nor acceptable. I am convinced that I'm just
            afraid of taking the first step, putting myself out there and risking rejection. I know things will go
            downhill (in a good way) once I take that first step but I just can't bring myself to do it.
            I'm not sure what or why I fear... I just know that if there's no mutual activity then I would rather
            be at home, bored, horny and sad. Maybe I'm scared of people actually getting to know me and
            discovering truths I try to hide and insecurities I am not ready to face. What if they ask questions
            I ran from and poke parts of me that are still soft and fragile? What if one of them becomes
            everything I could ever need? The point is that I am uncomfortable around people, and no matter
            how much I try to hide it, they can sense it. I can't help but collapse inward, becoming self conscious about it. That's
            why I need some kind of mutual activity to do with someone,
            something that requires me to be fully invested in the moment thus reducing my likelihood to
            zone out.
            There are nuances to my condition though. Chemistry with the people I am with is a big factor, do
            we respect each other? do we respect each other's ways of being (e.g. introverted and wise vs
            extroverted and funny)? do we accept silence as another element of the conversation rather than
            a void to be filled? Is there mutual interest in each other's lives and stories? These greatly
            influence my chemistry with others. Speaking of others, the more people there are, the less
            invested I am in the moment. I don't know why but I reckon my threshold is about 4 to 5 people
            with whom I have good chemistry, the more there are then the less I am there. But again, even
            fewer people with whom I have an average or below average chemistry with make me collapse. A
            mutual activity greatly reduces the weight though. The activity MUST require thinking and have
            visible results of progress. It should be able to progress when alone but work even better when
            shared. These are just trends I could notice, there are some I can only feel and cannot put into
            words. The biggest one would be safety, I don't have a criteria for this one but some people just
            feel safe to be around. I just feel free to be quiet around them and they may be bothered by it but
            they do not force conversation out of me. This is not a definitive criteria as I can be quiet around
            someone simply because I do not like them, have nothing in common with them or I just do not
            believe it would be appropriate to talk to them (e.g. my friends' girlfriends or when sat next to a
            random girl in a taxi).
            I do sometimes wish I was not like this. I am extremely selective about who I talk to but are super
            friendly to everyone, I have to have activity-filled bonding sessions with people and so intimate
            stuff like cuddle sessions and pillow talk freak me out, comfort becomes a driver of my social life
            which kinda takes the spunk put of my impulsiveness, and I can't go on regular dates.
            I do not, however, curse myself over this. I have a fully functional nervous system that is just
            going haywire, using my analytical mind to protect me.I also gained the ability to listen to people,
            and making them the center of conversations (self erasure is the skill here). You'd be surprised
            how much people love talking about themselves. I do too, that is why I have this. It is all the
            things I want to say to anyone who is willing to hear, anyone patient and interested in what I have
            to say. I have a lot to say. I just get so deep in my head that I fall out of the social rhythm.

            <p class="thoughtcontent"> 
            Recently, I've been questioning a lot about myself. In all fairness, this is not a recent thing, it's a
            habit. Today's meal is about gender and sexuality. The question at hand : Am I gay? Arguments
            may proceed.
            Argument in favour says there is not enough evidence to suggest that the boy is gay but there is
            noticeable proof that he may not be manly. There is a nuance. The boy is not your traditional
            masculine dude. He is not crazy about sports and cars, uncomfortable with competition, carries
            himself with grace rather than dominance, is gentle in speech and tone, and parents said they
            thought he was girl at birth. These are presented as evidence that his sexuality may be
            undetermined yet but his gender performance is certainly not aligned with typical masculinity.
            This is to say he does not meet the full criteria of being a man, which is amongst one of the
            telling signs of latent homosexuality. In a similar vein, the boy has hinted at a distrust and weak
            apprehension toward females, while also capable of engaging in deep & emotional conversations
            with them. This is not typical-man banter, but a capacity and desire to connect with others on a
            level far deeper than a traditional man would openly express. We do not believe he is gay, but
            evidence suggests that the notion is not far-fetched. We rest.
            Arguments against here, we do not agree with the notion. The boy is not gay. The primary
            premise for homosexuality is same-sex attraction. The absence of this quality is the absence of
            homosexuality. The boy still has a deep rooted appreciation and attraction toward the opposite
            sex, thus he is simply not gay. By extension, we also argue that he performs masculinity in his
            own unique way. He enjoys physical labour and mentally demanding physical projects. He enjoys
            working with ideas, objects and tools, he has visions of leading and commandeering in crisis
            situations, he dreams of raising a strong, competent and respectful offspring that he can be
            proud of. His only flaw is being a man in his own way. In ways modern and traditional masculinity
            of his context simply do not recognise. We argue against him being gay, and strongly oppose that
            he is not manly.
            Psychological point of view here, we hold that the boy's sexual and gender identity crises conceal
            a much darker conflict linked to his identity, attachment and social circumstances. The boy
            obviously has issues with connecting with others, this makes him susceptible to intimacy
            deprivation and a longing to be held. He struggles a lot in identity formation, trying to balance his
            agency with social responsibility makes it difficult for him to decide whether to sexually indulge
            or just be heterosexual. He also feels pressured to perform his masculinity as per social roles,
            this basically means he can't be a son, brother, uncle and cousin how he pleases, this greatly
            impacts his self-expression and disorients him from establishing a firm foundation for his
            choices. The boy simply masks all these as the manifest gender & sexuality conflicts.
            Existentialists would like to have a say. Whether the boy is gay or not is not important, what is
            important is that his life is his own and so he must decide for himself what he wants to be.
            Whether he chooses to be a homo or a cis, let that be HIS choice. Let him choose in spite of our
            views, let min choose scared, alone, and with a doubtful heart because only he can make his life
            worth something. Our perceptions of his actions, feelings and mental state are just that,
            perceptions. Only he knows what would make him happy, only he knows which choice has
            consequences he can bear. We must not rob him of the freedom to decide for himself. We are
            not determiners of his fate, we are the antagonists of his fear, cowardice, insecurity and doubt.
            Arguments were received and recognised. Those for the motion claim that he has indications of
            not being straight and thus may just be closeted. Those against say he has no attraction to
            members of his sex and acts as man but in his own unique way. The psychology behind the
            question asserts that the question is not the question being asked, but that deeper underlying
            forces must be addressed as the culprits of such questions. Existentialists took a hard stance,
            claiming that the question is irrelevant, the point is the freedom he must be granted to choose for
            himself.
            Much was pointed out but much was left unsaid, where do we draw the line between being a man
            in your own way and just defaming the idea of masculinity entirely? What about the boy's
            masochism and submissiveness in sexual fantasies? If the underlying crises are so important,
            why do they not reinforce existing sexual and gender identity but prompt its criticism? If the boy
            were to choose something and later regret it, who would be held accountable for not bringing
            such light in his preemptive protection? Much was pointed out but much wa sleft unsaid.
            Hopefully this doesn't make me go crazy🤗

                    People have the inherent capacity to do good. We also have the option not to. That is a childish
                    definition of evil, that it is anti-good. i define it as the extreme of anything, too many cooks spoil
                    the broth much the same way too much self love is pride, too much nourishment is gluttony, too
                    little love is indifference, too little kindness is cruelty and too little science is poetry.
                    I don't know how to feel about calling people evil but i genuinely feel like they have been exposed
                    to too much or too little so they figured they only solution is either succumb or compensate. You
                    succumb to a loveless home by fearing love or exhibiting the lack of love you may feel to the next
                    person. you compensate for it by excessive self-love, dependency, seclusion, nonchalance. Evil
                    people are victims of forces they had no control over, maybe this is me compensating for my
                    sense of powerlessness.
                    I am demonising qualities I wish I had, just as Christianity can see assertiveness as pride, maybe
                    I ascribe to evil what is to me an unattainable quality. I don't think I'm evil, but someone out there
                    thinks I am. It's weird to think about but it is what it is, I am a cog in the machine I'm studying.

                    Bear with me on this one. Programming has evolved substantially in a relatively short period of
                    time, in a couple of decades we went from punch cards and floppy disks, to computers that can
                    learn and think somewhat independently. That's a giant hop. One the peak benefits of the latter is
                    that now programmes can help programmers program programmes, imagine being able to help
                    God create your next baby, isn't that crazy?! This got so good that manual programming is not
                    only time consuming but has become substantially easier to learn.
                    This is where I come in. I have the content (literally ideas that I want to outlive me, reach
                    someone, weird them out and bring about world peace), the passion (i love systems, especially
                    when i have no business being around them), and the time (I'm 24 bro, young enough to learn
                    new skills, old enough to wisely adapt on the fly). When the limit of my knowledge befall me and I
                    crumble into dismay, ashamed of my own ignorance, I turn to the mother of the child I want to
                    birth. I beg her to at least not just lie there.
                    Ok. Basically, when I can't figure something out, I would ask the AI to help me. No, not vibe-coding
                    (that's just asking God to create another baby for you and fix it when it breaks, except God here is
                    extremely literal and takes everything verbatim). I still write the code and learn, it's just that it's
                    purely at my pace and there's pretty much no standardisation except one I self-impose. It's
                    learning manual coding while mastering AI fluency AND upgrading my personal skillset. It's one
                    thing to be a manual programmer, another to be a vibe-coder, it's an entirely new ball game to
                    navigate the tight rope between them without falling to either.
                    That's really one of the drawbacks of AAP. The difficulty of manual coding (of learning in general,
                    really) and the ease and convenience of vibe-coding kinda makes the whole thing extremely hard
                    to navigate, like driving on ice ... at full speed ... in traffic ... with a baby on board. That's how I
                    know it's worth the effort, when the easy way out is right there and the honour is only in the hard
                    route. My truth balances between them.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="person">
                I hardly ever wonder if I am a good friend, son, brother, co-worker or enemy. Yet i always wonder
                if I am a good person. Isn't that weird? I am assuming that personhood is separate from the
                fragments that make it up. Look, I am inclined to agree that people are more than the sum of
                their parts, but there is a golden thread that runs through those parts, harmonising them to form
                a unified image of personhood that becomes more than it is when the actor instills their own
                appraisal of said personhood. Indeed, it is both them and I that make me a good or bad person.
                For the most part, you'll never find a clear cut between those two camps, in fact, it is so rare that
                it is best to assume that most would be in the grey area between them, saying you're both or
                neither good nor bad. Extremism is hardly ever a good thing, if they hate you then all they see
                about is bad and vice versa.
                I think that's one of the key things about personhood and belonging that we tend to forget. That it
                is important, not to be loved, but to be understood, to be accepted, to be heard, and to belong.
                Finding ground zero is crucial, that's the golden thread, the one unifying quality of your
                personhood. Scientists do not look for the truth, they look for evidence of it, they look for
                witnesses who say "yes, this is the truth." Not only is finding the pure truth an extremely difficult
                endeavour, but it can just as easily "lie". Think Pluto, a victim of the truth. The seeker must
                consider their own experience as informative rather than declarative, only the evidence can
                determine their truth.
            </div>
           
            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="leapYr">
            This is just one of those "good to note" notes. The Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around
            the Sun.For a point on the Earth to move around the axis back to the origin, it would take ~24
            hours (in laymen's terms, one rotation is equal to 24 hours).For the Earth itself to move around
            the Sun all the way back to the original starting point it would take ~8766 hours, or 365.25 days.
            That's the foundation. You see the problem already?
            If a year = one revolution, then the year actually ends on the first day of the succeeding year at
            06:00. We both know how not ok that is. The difference is too small to shift the calendar but also
            too big to ignore. We cannot assign 6 more hours to December 31st and completely fall out of
            sync with Earth rotation, nor can we ignore the extra hours as the 6 hour decrement would throw
            off our conclusion with anything that has to do with Earth's revolution, such as weather
            predictions. We also can't just "start the New Year at that time" because that creates global
            incoherence that timezones wish they could compensate for, 06:00 and 18:00 would be the
            official hours for the New Year to begin on both hemispheres of the Earth, obviously not good. I
            personally think the biggest reason would be that those 6 hours... do not have a day. January first
            and December thirty-first are whole days as they are both 24 hours long. We cannot attribute the
            6 hours as the first day of the new year nor the last day of the past year because, by definition, it
            is not a day!
            So we can't add, ignore, or compensate yearly for those 6 hours. Perhaps we could do all that?
            Ignore the 6 hours for three years, add them together with the fourth year and compensate for
            the missing hours every four years with a day. This settles most concerns, with the added
            convenience of a month that's lacking days just makes it all the better. Leap Year is just that. A
            year where humans compensate for our incessant desire to standardise and rationalise, finally
            realising the limits to how much we control.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="fear">
                Anger and Fear are weird feelings. I can't find any reason they would overlap because one fights
                in power and another flees in weakness. Nothing physiological is useless, at least not
                evolutionarily. So anger is a feeling that gets us psyched against something, literally putting you
                in fight mode. Fear is the same but puts you in between fighting (similar to anger), getting the fuck outta there,
                freezing or just making yourself as small as possible. In the end I just think
                these are weird feelings. Very hard to express healthily too.
                I think I have a lot of fear. It's best described as anxiety though. Most of it is directed at my
                psychosocial safety and sense of worth. A good part of it is based on the futility of our existence
                and life's inherent meaninglessness. Most times I am afraid of being myself, sometimes I am
                afraid of one day losing everyone I love, sometimes it's the fear of dying alone because I chose
                Nietzsche while my peers chose Hennessy. All the time though, I am afraid of living a
                purposeless life.
                I do not think I am an angry person. I also do not think I have a lot of repressed anger. I think I am
                a scared person, dubbed myself fragile and weak. That's where my anger comes from, a deep
                desire to have some sense of control over my life. I do not yet have a healthy, socially acceptable
                way to express this anger, all my models showed how anger is evil and is used to oppress and
                destroy another person. It's a disgusting feeling. I am filthy from just thinking about it. So I would
                rather not express it. Wait...if my sense of fear is directly proportional to my anger then... I guess
                I do have a lot of repressed anger😂

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="infj">
            I think it was Myers and Briggs who came up with the personality trait test that reduces one's
            personality to a four letter code. Each letter represents a trait that is most prominent when
            assessing the responses provided by the assessee. I want to go through my code, just have proof
            that I actually agree with it. I was dubbed an INFJ/P, otherwise referred to as the mediator.
            The I refers to introversion over extroversion. It means I gain my vitality through interacting with
            my internal environment. I do better with small, intimate crowds and not a fan of the big groups
            and loud living. Couldn't agree more with this one. I don't do loud. I love my space. I don't want to
            be the center of attention and just being alone with my thoughts is enough for me. This does not
            mean I do not go outside or hang out with people, it means those are optional in rejuvenating my
            sense of vitality. Ideally I would have a cottage some where in the woods with other introverted
            people but instead I am in the suburbs, struggling to make friends and find my footing in a new
            city.
            N for intuition over sensing. Yep, i trust my gut feeling over facts. If something needs to be done
            then it better sit well with me otherwise I am not doing it. This means I am creative and great at
            coming up with novel solutions, sure they don't always make sense or align with reality but you
            can always count on me to say something unhinged. I wade through the world by gut and not
            concrete facts so my reasoning may be wonky but my ideas will always be fresh.
            F for feeling over Thinking. No surprise that someone who's intuitive is emotionally driven. My
            guide to making judgements is based on feelings, this means I am empathetic, patient,
            understanding and maybe a little bit emotionally unstable. I do not think things through, I feel
            them through. For me, how something makes me feel is a bigger metric than what sense it
            makes. Of course this is not ideal as it can lead to martyrdom or coldness but it has been great
            for someone interested in being a psychotherapist.
            J for Judging, which is on par with Perceiving. These are best described as descriptors of how I
            plan, whether i use lists and calendars and shit, or do I just wing it. I got a good balance of both. I
            do plan my budget but include an amount that is just for impulsive spending. It also means I
            control my freedom, an intuitive and emotional person has to have some structure lest he
            destroys himself. Boundaries, schedules, budgets and timelines are some of the ways I govern
            my impulsiveness.
            It is important to note that Myers and Briggs oversimplified one of the most complex phenomena
            in psychology. So, take what I claim with a grain of salt. The only comfort is that their claim has
            scientific grounding, unlike the zodiac people.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="genocide">
            I just read a story about a "white genocide" in my country. Trump and Musk are so horny for white
            supremacy and global superiority, they made up a story about how white farmers were subjected
            to racist policy and murder under the ANC government. In response, our president was like "bro...
            we don't murder white people... we murder everybody󰣿".
            I have thoughts. Firstly, the president is right. Undoubtedly, more black people are murdered in
            South Africa than white people. This is just demographic probabilities 󰣿. A majority of farms
            employ black workers, therefore, in time of attack, it is far more likely that a black person would
            be hurt or worse than the other race. More black people are victims of crime simply because of
            probability as they make up a majority of the population 󰣿.
            Secondly, it is not necessarily a race thing... ok maybe not entirely... ok it's a race thing. Apartheid
            ensured wealth is unevenly distributed along racial lines, white farmers are the epitome of that
            wealth. I'm not sure why criminals would target farms, maybe because they are isolated and
            enforcers would take real time to travel there, maybe the farmer's false sense of security got
            them to buy fancy, expensive things, maybe they are easier targets than a fancy mansion with 64
            cameras at each door󰣿 look I'm no criminal so I can't reason for them. All I know is that no one
            wants a difficult journey to their desire, criminals included. A majority of farms are easy targets
            with the potential for a big score since they're owned by white people
            Thirdly, it makes sense that the government's redistributive policy threatens the privileged. Gov't
            is simply trying to even out the massive wealth gap within the population, a wealth gap based on
            a racist historical system thus making wealth racially segregated, at least between white and
            non-white groups. It is understandable that the policy can be. interpreted as being anti-white
            when it is anti-wealth-gap. The expropriation bill is not racially motivated, the wealth hoarded by
            previous generations of white farmers as a result of Apartheid, however, is.
            Look I'm no political analyst but I'm convinced of a hidden agenda. The Trump Admin is
            aggressively trying to push a narrative disputed by plenty of knowledgeable people and even
            denied by the very people they claim to be the saviours of. They are either trying to punish RSA
            for expressing its sovereignty or they just tryna bomb us and Trump doesn't wanna hurt his best
            friend's people. This is exactly why I don't do politics, I feel so powerless at the sight of all these
            names. Thank God we at least have a competent and competitive political landscape, otherwise
            we would be getting bullied more than we already are.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="science">
            I know a bunch of random science stuff i got into throughout my life. See, ever since i was a
            handsome baby, I've had a thing for science🤭idk man, i think it started in the fourth grade when i
            found out about the solar system. big balls of rocks and gas and gravity and heat and space and
            all that! Something about that whole thing made me horny🥴. That's when i started reading up on
            anything that piqued my interest.
            Schrodinger's cat. Everyone knows this one. A theory in quantum mechanics that basically states
            that two seemingly polar options exist simultaneously, and that observation is the only way to
            certain one option. I'm not sure what it's for, but i recall something along the lines of something
            being in two oppositional states but immediately being fixed on one upon measurement,
            observation to be specific. It really doesn't make sense to me but I love the approach. Anything is
            possible until we actually observe it. There's prolly a life lesson somewhere in there too🤔.
            Lightyears are another weird phenomenon I couldn't stop thinking about. What do you mean the
            fastest thing IN EXISTENCE takes YEARS to travel a distance?!?! The distances in space are so
            incomprehensible, like i get that the Earth's hundreds of thousands of kilometres wide, but i just
            can't wrap my head around the fact that there is a distance so far away that light, the fastest
            thing in existence (i think), takes YEARS to cover it. That's insane.
            What's even more insane is that we can never ever go that fast since we are made of matter, and
            so is everything else that keeps us alive. I'm not sure whether light can travel that fast because it
            is not matter; or maybe it's a unique kind of matter, like plasma, or maybe the qualities of light
            and its speed are simply impossible for anything with matter to possess. The basic definition of
            matter is anything that has mass (can be affected by gravity) and volume (can take up space),
            light can be affected by gravity that is strong enough (like that of a black hole) but light is
            physically incapable of taking up space, it's just particles bouncing off objects and not an actual
            visible thing (the irony isn't lost). I have not refined this idea yet but I think i read somewhere that
            matter would literally break down if it attempted to move at a noticeable fraction of light speed,
            friction (produces heat, matter would simply burn) is amongst the bigger inhibitors.
            Now, chaos theory is one idea that really got me thinking. It claims that in any apparent chaotic
            system, there's an underying law, rule or order that keeps the entire thing chaotically consistent.
            In essence, it rejects randomness as an explanation for chaos. It basically describes the
            behaviour of a system that make no obvious sense. Evidence of its validity can be found across
            multiple domains of science, especially social science. Social problems appear chaotic until you
            start noticing the patterns, the colonial history, government corruption, loss of values and
            negotiable judiciary processes. The child might seem unruly and disorderly, until you start
            noticing that this is a trend amongst fatherless and impoverished in anomic townships. There are
            patterns in everything and everyone, self awareness is to notice and critically analyse them to
            draw conclusions about them, politics are identifying systematic trends and identifying their
            most probable cause and effective solution. Just like that I got roped into sociological thinking,
            linking what appear to be chaotic phenomena to regular structural patterns. Just... wow🤗

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="faith">
            Once upon a time, I had faith. I believed there is a good, powerful, just and loving God. I believed
            people were good and just made bad choices. I believed ancestors were fair and reasonable as
            the people they once were. My years in university broke that. They broke everything I used to hold
            up my sense of meaning. Behavioral Sciences, what an eye opening experience that discipline is😔
            Psychology. It was supposed to be Freud and "Love Yourself" all over my notes, little did I know
            what it held for me💔Psych 121 explored social and community psychology, basically arguing
            that milieu has more impact on individual behaviour than i thought. I learnt that people influence
            people without their consent. People are brilliant individually but so predictable as a collective.
            We seem to exert some kind of coercive group mindset when in social situations, mandating a
            need to belong and be consistent with the group. It's why most would rather watch than intervene
            when one of our own is in trouble. We all happen to think "someone should have intervened by
            now" and so we all freeze, waiting for that someone. Brilliant individually, dumb as a herd.
            Sociology, the study of society and its constituents. This is where my faith really got destroyed.
            All major classical theories conclude that faith is both universal and can be weaponised. The
            works of Karl Marx come to mind. That piece of shit made me aware of how much suffering
            humans inflict on each other just to bag a bigger bag before they die. He made me aware of how
            social systems and their components are constantly weaponised in the name of wealth retention
            and oppression of the working class. The system of capitalism exploits faith to pacify the
            masses that it needed to maintain the uneven power relations that perpetuate uneven wealth
            distribution and distraught poverty. I couldn't stop thinking about it. My faith, a weapon against
            me. The realisation disoriented me. My critical mind couldn't stop thinking about how much
            power we believe God has yet his most vulnerable continue to be vulnerable, how the Bible
            glorifies poverty and submissiveness to authority like badges of honour, how God's people would
            rather build mega churches than be on the ground and make an actual difference in people's
            lives, how the Word demonises qualities that uphold individuality and self-direction., i just
            spiralled.
            I could not hold my meaning framework with the evidence I had been provided. I could not
            pretend that the argument posited by science was not valid, plausible or, to a degree, true. My
            mind refused to accept Christianity as it were nor believe my will becomes secondary in social
            situations, but I knew that forces that shape said circumstances were too great for me to
            overcome alone. So i delved into existential philosophy after receiving inspiration from Viktor
            Frankl on suffering and meaning. I met Nietzsche and Camus who told me about life being
            inherently meaningless and so it befell man to make it meaningful. My faith collapsed because
            the reality of its foundation was no longer able to tolerate the reality I then lived in nor was it able
            to keep up with my sudden, rapid growth. I had to breakthrough to the other side of the void, I
            could abandon my faith entirely or make it adapt to who, when and where i am. In any case, my
            faith was imposed on me and i adopted it, now that I have every reason to let it go-it became ever
            more beautiful to have it by choice. Existentialism made bearing human suffering, greed,
            mortality and futility all the more bearable.
            I got to meet urban anthropology and its arguments of contemporary evidence for the use of
            systems and structures to perpetuate poverty and uneven wealth distribution, inducing and
            maintaining affluence for some and suffering for most. Sociology also struck a pivot, debating on
            environmental, social and educational inequality as being products of a self-fulfilling system that
            feeds off the legacy of Apartheid, contemporary capitalist assertions and a failing government.
            All these were topped up with Psychopathology, a module that showed me how scary psychiatry
            and clinical practice are. From narcissistic and bipolar people to schizophrenics and split
            personality disorders, nothing about my final year was good or soothing except that it was MY
            FINAL YEAR.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="aloof">
            People can see me as aloof, weird and a bit awkward. None of these are lies. I honestly struggle
            to be "normal" (whatever that means) and it feels so overwhelming to have to pretend to be. I
            have to say the right things, gesture appropriately, time my inputs, manage my emotions, be
            comfortable and promote conversation all in a single interaction!
            Look, I know there's something off about me. I can't pathologise it because it might just be a
            normal personality trait I just never see in others, but I also can't normalise it as it really affects
            how I interact with people. I'm not sure what, if at all, is wrong but I know that dreading to talk to
            people is not something people would see as normal nor acceptable. I am convinced that I'm just
            afraid of taking the first step, putting myself out there and risking rejection. I know things will go
            downhill (in a good way) once I take that first step but I just can't bring myself to do it.
            I'm not sure what or why I fear... I just know that if there's no mutual activity then I would rather
            be at home, bored, horny and sad. Maybe I'm scared of people actually getting to know me and
            discovering truths I try to hide and insecurities I am not ready to face. What if they ask questions
            I ran from and poke parts of me that are still soft and fragile? What if one of them becomes
            everything I could ever need? The point is that I am uncomfortable around people, and no matter
            how much I try to hide it, they can sense it. I can't help but collapse inward, becoming self conscious about it. That's
            why I need some kind of mutual activity to do with someone,
            something that requires me to be fully invested in the moment thus reducing my likelihood to
            zone out.
            There are nuances to my condition though. Chemistry with the people I am with is a big factor, do
            we respect each other? do we respect each other's ways of being (e.g. introverted and wise vs
            extroverted and funny)? do we accept silence as another element of the conversation rather than
            a void to be filled? Is there mutual interest in each other's lives and stories? These greatly
            influence my chemistry with others. Speaking of others, the more people there are, the less
            invested I am in the moment. I don't know why but I reckon my threshold is about 4 to 5 people
            with whom I have good chemistry, the more there are then the less I am there. But again, even
            fewer people with whom I have an average or below average chemistry with make me collapse. A
            mutual activity greatly reduces the weight though. The activity MUST require thinking and have
            visible results of progress. It should be able to progress when alone but work even better when
            shared. These are just trends I could notice, there are some I can only feel and cannot put into
            words. The biggest one would be safety, I don't have a criteria for this one but some people just
            feel safe to be around. I just feel free to be quiet around them and they may be bothered by it but
            they do not force conversation out of me. This is not a definitive criteria as I can be quiet around
            someone simply because I do not like them, have nothing in common with them or I just do not
            believe it would be appropriate to talk to them (e.g. my friends' girlfriends or when sat next to a
            random girl in a taxi).
            I do sometimes wish I was not like this. I am extremely selective about who I talk to but are super
            friendly to everyone, I have to have activity-filled bonding sessions with people and so intimate
            stuff like cuddle sessions and pillow talk freak me out, comfort becomes a driver of my social life
            which kinda takes the spunk put of my impulsiveness, and I can't go on regular dates.
            I do not, however, curse myself over this. I have a fully functional nervous system that is just
            going haywire, using my analytical mind to protect me.I also gained the ability to listen to people,
            and making them the center of conversations (self erasure is the skill here). You'd be surprised
            how much people love talking about themselves. I do too, that is why I have this. It is all the
            things I want to say to anyone who is willing to hear, anyone patient and interested in what I have
            to say. I have a lot to say. I just get so deep in my head that I fall out of the social rhythm.

            <div class="thoughtcontent" id="gay"> 
            Recently I have been questioning a lot about myself.In all fairness, this is not a recent thing, it's a
            habit. Today's meal is about gender and sexuality. The question at hand : Am I gay? Arguments
            may proceed.
            Argument in favour says there is not enough evidence to suggest that the boy is gay but there is
            noticeable proof that he may not be manly. There is a nuance. The boy is not your traditional
            masculine dude. He is not crazy about sports and cars, uncomfortable with competition, carries
            himself with grace rather than dominance, is gentle in speech and tone, and parents said they
            thought he was girl at birth. These are presented as evidence that his sexuality may be
            undetermined yet but his gender performance is certainly not aligned with typical masculinity.
            This is to say he does not meet the full criteria of being a man, which is amongst one of the
            telling signs of latent homosexuality. In a similar vein, the boy has hinted at a distrust and weak
            apprehension toward females, while also capable of engaging in deep & emotional conversations
            with them. This is not typical-man banter, but a capacity and desire to connect with others on a
            level far deeper than a traditional man would openly express. We do not believe he is gay, but
            evidence suggests that the notion is not far-fetched. We rest.
            Arguments against here, we do not agree with the notion. The boy is not gay. The primary
            premise for homosexuality is same-sex attraction. The absence of this quality is the absence of
            homosexuality. The boy still has a deep rooted appreciation and attraction toward the opposite
            sex, thus he is simply not gay. By extension, we also argue that he performs masculinity in his
            own unique way. He enjoys physical labour and mentally demanding physical projects. He enjoys
            working with ideas, objects and tools, he has visions of leading and commandeering in crisis
            situations, he dreams of raising a strong, competent and respectful offspring that he can be
            proud of. His only flaw is being a man in his own way. In ways modern and traditional masculinity
            of his context simply do not recognise. We argue against him being gay, and strongly oppose that
            he is not manly.
            Psychological point of view here, we hold that the boy's sexual and gender identity crises conceal
            a much darker conflict linked to his identity, attachment and social circumstances. The boy
            obviously has issues with connecting with others, this makes him susceptible to intimacy
            deprivation and a longing to be held. He struggles a lot in identity formation, trying to balance his
            agency with social responsibility makes it difficult for him to decide whether to sexually indulge
            or just be heterosexual. He also feels pressured to perform his masculinity as per social roles,
            this basically means he can't be a son, brother, uncle and cousin how he pleases, this greatly
            impacts his self-expression and disorients him from establishing a firm foundation for his
            choices. The boy simply masks all these as the manifest gender & sexuality conflicts.
            Existentialists would like to have a say. Whether the boy is gay or not is not important, what is
            important is that his life is his own and so he must decide for himself what he wants to be.
            Whether he chooses to be a homo or a cis, let that be HIS choice. Let him choose in spite of our
            views, let min choose scared, alone, and with a doubtful heart because only he can make his life
            worth something. Our perceptions of his actions, feelings and mental state are just that,
            perceptions. Only he knows what would make him happy, only he knows which choice has
            consequences he can bear. We must not rob him of the freedom to decide for himself. We are
            not determiners of his fate, we are the antagonists of his fear, cowardice, insecurity and doubt.
            Arguments were received and recognised. Those for the motion claim that he has indications of
            not being straight and thus may just be closeted. Those against say he has no attraction to
            members of his sex and acts as man but in his own unique way. The psychology behind the
            question asserts that the question is not the question being asked, but that deeper underlying
            forces must be addressed as the culprits of such questions. Existentialists took a hard stance,
            claiming that the question is irrelevant, the point is the freedom he must be granted to choose for
            himself.
            Much was pointed out but much was left unsaid, where do we draw the line between being a man
            in your own way and just defaming the idea of masculinity entirely? What about the boy's
            masochism and submissiveness in sexual fantasies? If the underlying crises are so important,
            why do they not reinforce existing sexual and gender identity but prompt its criticism? If the boy
            were to choose something and later regret it, who would be held accountable for not bringing
            such light in his preemptive protection? Much was pointed out but much wa sleft unsaid.
            Hopefully this doesn't make me go crazy🤗
