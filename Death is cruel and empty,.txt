Death is cruel and empty,
he cares not for how much joy you brought to me,
or how much your smile made my days worthwhile,
or how your hugs made my deepest depths warm.

Death did not ask me why i didn't love your harder.
I think it's because i thought lightbulbs don't need light,
donkeys are never carried and water never needs to be quenched,
i thought your burdens were everything but light.

Death walked in, saw something that meant everything to me,
and said i deserve pain for my selfishness.
I could have sworn i love you as much i hate my self,
I  love everything about you, everything i could never be.

Death said i loved your smile when i had one too,
he said i borrowed your silence to comfort my chaos,
that i gave you joy to if it hugged my peace,
he said i loved myself enough to make me believe i love you.

Death is a liar...he is not real, he is coward.
He hides and lurks when i wake and flees when i see your eyes.
I hate the way he thinks he has it all figured out,
his arrogance sense of entitlement to my happiness disgusts me.

Though i may never feel your hugs and my cold, bitter heart withers, 
know that i will despise death for what he took 
from you...from me...from us and everything we could have been.
i  will wake each day to hate death more than i hate myself.

i am happy you that he will no longer taunt me from your shoulder, 
heaven may have gained a rose, but death inherited its thorns.
