                                This is my pet project, it's not really meant to showcase my skills to the visitor. It is merely a project I would love to share with others & allows me to develop my frontend skills with no obligation, pressure or oversight. You are currently experiencing the latest version of the site😁

                                This was my first big-boy project. I had just landed a job as an ICT assistant and tasked with creating a website for the school. I had solid HTML, average CSS and poor JS, AI tools and experiences were crucial to getting through the project and maintaining my mental health. You can check my work <a href="">here</a>. More details are available upon request.

                                I div class="figure"d I can finally go back to school and append Mathematics into my NSC. Not really for further education but just to satisfy a childhood urge. I enjoy the challenge but it has not been a walk in the park. Without the scaffold of the formal education system, discipline, consistency and monitoring have really been a pain to deal with. So far, I have mastered Sequences and Functions... still a long way to go though😓.

                                It's not a real word. It just means my tendency to be a nerd and do nerd things. So far I have done my home's electrical wiring and perimeter fencing to feel more masculine, auctioned myself at retail stores to try out physical labour, done brief contracts with electricians out of boredom, created a script that diables my PC's keyboard for when I want to wipe it or prevent my niece from using it, and branded myself the IT wizard of the family (I just follow user manuals really well).

                            It is exactly what it sounds like. I had to find ways to pass on the knowledge I had & make some coin from it. Job was super flexible and easy to manage, loved how my students arrived confused and left slightly less confused. Taught me to take initiative but to balance with responsibility, learnt that I can only ever do so much.

                        <p>
                            My first big-boy job. Misleading name. I was actually closer to a script marker. Honestly, nothing was more liberating than discovering how lecturers mark essays. The criteria is so simple, but it's asked in a way that makes it seem complicated. The leniency we had to exhibit was so much that we essentially had to give out marks for mentioning something that vaguely seemed to reflect the concept mentioned. I loved how I had to stretch my POV to see the points made by the students, challenging but critical to my perspective-taking skills.

                            My second big-boy job, first that's ICT-centred. I learnt more about myself here, for instance, it turns out students and learners do not learn the same way and I did not know that. I also learnt that I can handle steep learning curves when doing so independently. The only significant love I had was for the version of myself I grew into🥹

                            5 stars out of 8 million. Would not recommend. The job was great, it's the physical labour of it that I hated. I'd get home tired, muscles sore and only have enough time to sleep and go back the next day. If it wasn't for the people I met there, I would have filed for notice on the second day. I learnt that I can endure stuff, my muscular, psychological and emotional resilience are really on fleek. To this day, my former colleagues still show me the warmth and love as they did on my first day. I am eternally grateful for them.

                        <p>
                            It was a week. I got bored and decided to be a handyman for two electricians working at the place I was around. Got electricuted multiple times but that led to a lesson. I really enjoy taking initiative. I work best with guidelines than rules. I loved seeing how my assistance was a hand in bringing light and power to people. It's really all about Ubuntu.

                        <p>
                            As you may have noted, my coding skills have no formal education basis but grow from exposure and persistent learning. I have incorporated multiple AI tools for guidance whenever I meet the ceiling of my knowledge. I swear it's mostly guidance. I have asked AI to write certain parts of certain coding projects (this was explicitly stated in the source code of the school website) but for the most part I used it as a scaffold and guide to problem that I simply cannot resolve due to my inherent limits. This term is best described in my <a href="">diary</a>, it's not vibe-coding but it's also not manual coding. It blends the convinience of AI with the irreplaceable human element to provide structured and efficient learning for sustainable skills development outside traditional and modern education streams (although it is arguably an element of the latter)

                    <p>The first nationally recognised certificate. It basically means you attained both basic education and have foundationla knowledge and skills for specialisation in a certian field based on the subjects selcted in Grades 10 to 12.I opted for social sciences because I div class="figure"d that was my calling, to understand & help people</p>

                    <p>My first degree, completed at the prestigious North West University. The best course for my calling, placing me at center of human behaviour at a personal and social level. I attained and honorary pass with distinction. I knew I wnated to help people, but i had no way to base it on my strengths and interests</p>

                    <button>Siyavula Online Practice for Grade 12 Mathematics</button>
                    <p>This is where i discovered a lve for systematic, logical thinking, scratching an itch I could never reach. Although it isn't a credited certifcate, it showed me the strength I never knew I had and potential I could not just ignore. Understanding people was good but what if we could find the expression that satisfied  both my newfound itch and my desire to understand and help people? </p>

                    <p>Arguably what sparked my desire to do Tech Support. It simplies the often overwhleming and complex field of Computer Science into digestable lectures and practicals. I am still struggling to fully grasp certain concepts as the languages grow more and more complex from Scratch to C#, but I have not given up. Having this certificate would certainly boost my employability and self-confidence.</p>

Of the five modules, i have certificates for three, namely: Systems Administration, Networking and Operating Systems fundamentals.</p>

                        The fundamental of working with AI. The strengths and possibilities it held, the challenges and pitfalls it bears, and the unwavering spirit of perseverence inherent in every proffessional field. I knew that I have barriers i could never overcome on my own given my background, but here I was presented a tool that could be my internet, code companion, tutor and advisor at the push of a button. AI is closest mimicry to human intelligence ever developed, and there I was, learnign how to wield it efficiently.
