Pet Peeves
My hands smelling like the food I worked with, even after I bathed.

Wearing tight clothing. Especially shirts and underwear.

When walking beside someone and they constantly change the side they walk on. Like being on
my right one minute then changing to my left for no apparent reason, then back to my right again.

People who take time to make their point or better yet, people who talk in premises and never get
to the conclusion. ("oh i did A, B and C, I did A because of 1, 2 and 3 but not 4 because 4 would
mean...").

Similarly, people who under-explain by over-explaining. Masters of the Strawman Fallacy in
defence.

Games that don't have a linear interface. "To change the setting D from interface Y, you need to
go to A, then B, then C, then save and hit the back button until you get back to Y, if u hit back here,
your settings are reset and you need to start over again"

The smell of salt makes me so angry, I do not know why😭

Food without gravy or some sort of lube😭

Heavy blankets.

People who lack accountability, always having an excuse, one wherein they are the victim.

Gents who paint their nails. Girls who've installed nails and wigs.

Poems that are literally just stories.
